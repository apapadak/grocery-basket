Grocery basket in AngularJS + currency conversion

<a target="_blank" href="https://apapadak.github.io/grocery-basket/">Live demo</a>

Note: CurrencyLayer supports https only on a basic subscription plan. So the 'Available Currencies' button won't work on the Github project <a target="_blank" href="https://apapadak.github.io/grocery-basket/">page</a> which runs on https.
Clone the repo and run it on your local server.
